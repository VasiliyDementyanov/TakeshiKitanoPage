# Takeshi Kitano page

**Takeshi Kitano** is a Japanese comedian, television presenter, actor, filmmaker, and author. 
I like movies he made and I have decided to create this page in order to show my knowledge of **React, webpack, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.**

Here you can find [Figma project](https://www.figma.com/file/9Tf8QuoCipEiX3PnP9CNcR/Takeshi-Kitano) (you can also run prototype).

In this project I'm using [The Movie Database (TMDb) API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/) in order to get movie's titles and posters.
